# password_checker - Project overview
Using website Pwned's API to check if your passwords have been leaked.

This script is written while I followed the online course "Complete Python Developer in 2020: 0 to Master" on Udemy, taught by Andrei Neagoie. 
I added a small feature by accessing the passwords that need to be checked via reading from a txt file, as suggested in the lecture.

*Environment and packages: Python 3.7, libraries: requests hashlib
